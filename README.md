## Overview  
The workforce is the most critical asset of any organization, and **data-driven HR practices** are essential for optimizing performance, improving retention, and promoting equitable talent development.  
This HR analytics project uses **Power BI** to transform raw employee data into actionable insights across **headcount, attrition, demographics, satisfaction, and performance**.  
By visualizing trends across departments, roles, and time, the report equips HR leaders with the knowledge to align workforce strategy with organizational goals.

## Problem Statement  
Despite having access to HR data, many organizations struggle to translate it into meaningful insights.  
Without a unified view of key workforce metrics, it becomes difficult to:
- Identify turnover risks  
- Manage diversity and inclusion  
- Track employee engagement  
- Plan future hiring effectively  

This often leads to high attrition, poor workforce alignment, and stalled talent development initiatives.

## Objectives  
The main objective is to help **Atlas Labs** make data-driven decisions to improve workforce management. This project aims to:

- **Monitor Workforce Trends:** Track hiring, department structure, and demographics.  
- **Analyze Employee Satisfaction & Performance:** Understand job satisfaction, work-life balance, and managerial effectiveness.  
- **Reduce Attrition:** Identify drivers of turnover and retain top talent.  
- **Enhance HR Decision-Making:** Provide interactive dashboards for real-time insights.  
- **Optimize Retention Strategies:** Examine travel, overtime, and tenure patterns in relation to attrition.

## Potential Questions Explored  
- Which departments have the most active employees?  
- How are job roles distributed across departments?  
- How has hiring changed over the years?  
- What is the age, gender, and ethnic distribution of the workforce?  
- What are satisfaction trends over time?  
- Where is attrition highest by department, role, or tenure?  
- How do travel and overtime relate to employee turnover?  

## Key Findings  

- **Headcount & Attrition:** Out of 1,470 employees, 237 are inactive, with an attrition rate of **16.1%**, higher than the healthy benchmark (10–12%).  
- **Hiring Patterns:** Recruitment has been inconsistent, indicating reactive rather than strategic hiring.  
- **Departmental Focus:** Tech and Sales dominate headcount; HR is under-resourced.  
- **Age Distribution:** Majority are aged **20–29**, indicating a youthful, early-career workforce.  
- **Marital Status:** Most employees are married, suggesting family-friendly policies could be impactful.  
- **Ethnicity & Pay:** White and Black/African American employees make up the bulk of the workforce. Pay disparities suggest equity gaps.  
- **Gender Trends:** Balanced among young employees but uneven at senior levels.  
- **Satisfaction Declines:** Job satisfaction, manager effectiveness, and workplace environment ratings have dropped, especially after 2020.  
- **Attrition Risk Areas:** High among **Sales Reps**, **Recruiters**, and **Data Scientists**; also spikes for employees hired in certain years and for those traveling frequently.  
- **Tenure Sensitivity:** Attrition peaks in the **first year**, indicating onboarding gaps.
